To Do's
------
- [ ] create webp fallback images (progressive jpg/transparent png) and have them load automagically for unsupported browsers.
- [ ] modal and css dialog support.
- [ ] add image previews to gallery and possibly sorting order.
- [ ] move inline block javascript to footer (bigger pain than I thought were possible).
